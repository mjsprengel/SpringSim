# SpringSim
Interactive mass on a spring simulation running off of Python's standard library. 

Utilizes the hyper realistic Euler-Cromer timestep integration method on a summation of forces to solve for the position of a mass attached to two springs, each with fixed endpoints. 

Todo: add scroll bars providing interactivity for various parameters like mass, spring constant, damping coefficient, and spring length.
